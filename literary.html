								<h1>Literary Criticism: Psychoanalytic Theory</h1>
								<p>According to Sigmund Freud, Austrian psychologist, human behavior is driven by the parts of the mind known as the id, the ego and the superego.
								</p><p><b>Id</b>: primitive and instinctual part of the mind that contains hidden memories and aggressive and sexual drives. The id demands that every impulse should be satisfied immediately, regardless of consequence.</p><p>
								</p><p><b>Superego</b>: While the Id contains our primal desires, the superego operates as a moral conscience, regulating our every actions and desires. While the Id demands short-term goals and ignores consequences, the Superego strive for the most favorable outcome in the long term.
								</p><p><b>Ego</b>: Realistically, no human can ever operate either on the Superego or the Id primarily, so they operate on the Ego, which is the middle ground for the desires of the Id and the Superego. The Ego ensure that action driven by impulses are expressed in acceptable manners and ensure moral action still satisfy personal needs.

When fueled by the desires of the Id, the Twitch streamers tend to do illegal or otherwise socially unacceptable things such as showing explicit contents, harassing or threatening somebody or doing drugs while they’re streaming. However, the streamers are not the only ones engaging in id-fueled behavior, as the audience can often be seen engaging in harassment or otherwise egging the streamer’s inappropriate behavior on. 
								</p>								<p><b>The Ego:</b>Although Twitch may be an environment where id- influenced actions thrive, there is plenty of content on Twitch that reflects the ego-driven desires of the users. While these streams are fun and engages the audience, they also remain appropriate for the general audience and abide to the community guidelines. Most of the content on Twitch, from regular gaming streams to singing streams, reflect our desires to have fun and experience bliss, while still conforming to our and society’s values.
 
								<img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MNQZ9YJNYt8/maxresdefault.jpg" width="50%" height="50%">								<p><b>The Superego:</b>Because Twitch was built as a platform for entertainment, content that is driven by the superego can be rare, or at least uncommon because the audience feels that extremely moderated content can be bland, if not boring. However, there still exists a minority of content that is acceptable to our superegos. Live-streamed talk shows, tutorials or educational streams are all content is filtered and screened, only showing the streamers and the audience in the best light.
